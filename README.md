# pyDrupal
Drupal code gen python helper

## Purpose

Intended to provide a method for something like an LLM to modify config, schema etc using base PHP APIs into Drupal.  This project will be tagged by compatible Drupal core version.  There are better ways to do most of this, including interactive Drush commands and using the Drupal UI, so this won't be useful to most humans.
